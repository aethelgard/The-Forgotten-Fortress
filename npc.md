## Maldrake (Old Sage)
**Location**: Entrance Hall

**Description**: An elderly man with a long white beard and tattered blue robes. He leans heavily on a gnarled wooden staff. His eyes are milky with age but seem to hold ancient wisdom. Despite his frail appearance, his voice is strong and clear.

**Background**: Maldrake was once the court wizard of the kingdom. When the dungeon was still a thriving underground fortress, he served as an advisor to its ruler. After the catastrophe that turned this place into a monster-infested ruin, he remained as a guardian of knowledge, hoping to guide worthy adventurers.

**Dialogue**:
- **Question**: "What is this place?"
  **Answer**: "You stand in what was once the proud underground fortress of King Alaric the Bold. Now it is but a shadow of its former glory, overrun by monsters and haunted by those who cannot leave its halls. I remain to guide those who might put its restless spirits to peace."

- **Question**: "Who are you?"
  **Answer**: "I am Maldrake, once Court Wizard to King Alaric. Age has weakened my body but not my mind. I have remained here to guide travelers such as yourself who might help right the wrongs of the past."

- **Question**: "What happened here?"
  **Answer**: "Greed and dark magic, a terrible combination. The King's wizard advisors, myself among them, discovered an ancient dragon sleeping beneath these halls. Against my counsel, they attempted to harness its power for magical experiments. The dragon awoke in fury, and many died in the aftermath. The survivors fled, but some of us remain, unable or unwilling to leave."

- **Question**: "Are there any treasures here?"
  **Answer**: "Indeed, great wealth remains in these halls. The king's treasury, the dragon's hoard, and many smaller caches of valuables can be found by those brave or foolish enough to seek them. But beware—treasures often have guardians."

- **Question**: "How do I defeat the dragon?"
  **Answer**: "The ancient dragon is a fearsome foe, nearly invincible in direct combat. However, in the Wizard's Study, there are notes about a weakness. The dragon's scales are impervious except for a single patch on its chest where a previous adventurer landed a blow. Strike there with a powerful weapon, and you might stand a chance."

- **Question**: "Are there any secret passages?"
  **Answer**: "This fortress was built with many secrets. Look behind the mounted beast head in the Trophy Room, search the Wizard's desk carefully, and examine the Captain's quarters thoroughly. The builders of this place valued hidden routes for escape and surprise."

- **Question**: "Do you need help with anything?"
  **Answer**: "My earthly needs are long past, but if you wish to ease an old man's regrets, find and defeat the dragon that I helped awaken. In the Treasury Vault, you'll find an amulet that belonged to me. Returning it would bring me peace, though I ask this only if your path takes you there naturally."

## Elmdrin (Scholar Ghost)
**Location**: Library

**Description**: A translucent figure in scholarly robes, with spectacles perched on his nose. Books and scrolls float around him as he mutters and takes notes with an ethereal quill. He appears completely absorbed in his research, barely noticing the physical world around him.

**Background**: In life, Elmdrin was the royal archivist and scholar, dedicated to preserving knowledge. When disaster struck, he refused to leave his precious books and died in the library. Now his ghost continues his work, cataloging and preserving the knowledge contained in the ancient tomes.

**Dialogue**:
- **Question**: "What are you researching?"
  **Answer**: "Ah, a fellow scholar perhaps? I am documenting the magical properties of enchanted objects found throughout the fortress. Did you know the Wizard's Staff in the study can amplify magical abilities threefold? Or that the Holy Symbol in the temple can repel undead creatures? Knowledge is power, especially in dangerous places like this."

- **Question**: "What happened to the library?"
  **Answer**: "Such a tragedy! When the dragon awoke, many fled with whatever treasures they could carry. Some foolish souls tried to steal the magical books, triggering the library's defensive enchantments. The animated books you see are a result of those protections gone awry after centuries without maintenance. I remain to catalog what survives."

- **Question**: "Can you help me with magic?"
  **Answer**: "While I cannot cast spells in my current form, I can offer knowledge. The glowing potion on the shelf will restore your vitality. In the Wizard's Study, you'll find a staff that enhances magical abilities. And should you encounter the animated books, know they fear fire and loud noises."

- **Question**: "Do you know about any secret rooms?"
  **Answer**: "As the keeper of records, I know all the architectural secrets of this place. The Wizard maintained a secret laboratory accessible from his study—look for a book titled 'Illusory Walls and Their Construction' to find the hidden lever. There's also a treasure room connected to the Trophy Room via a hidden passage."

- **Question**: "What's the most valuable book here?"
  **Answer**: "Value is subjective, is it not? For monetary worth, the Ancient Spellbook bound in dragon leather would fetch a high price. For practical value, I'd suggest the small journal on the third shelf—it contains the alchemical formula for the healing potions found throughout the dungeon, allowing you to identify which are safe to consume."

- **Question**: "How did you die?"
  **Answer**: "Die? Oh, I suppose I have, haven't I? It's easy to forget when one's work continues. When the dragon was awakened, I refused to abandon the library. As the fortress was evacuated, I stayed to protect the rarest volumes. The smoke from the fires in adjacent chambers eventually overcame me while I was securing the ancient texts in protective cases."

- **Question**: "Are there any dangerous books I should avoid?"
  **Answer**: "Indeed, exercise caution with the red-bound tome on the eastern shelf—it contains binding spells that activate upon reading. The small black book with silver clasps is a journal that drives readers to madness; I've sealed it shut. And of course, avoid disturbing the animated books unless you're prepared for a fight."

## Myrna (Ghostly Server)
**Location**: Dining Hall

**Description**: A young woman in serving clothes, carrying a spectral tray of food and drinks. She flickers in and out of visibility as she moves between the tables, eternally setting places and serving phantom guests. Her friendly smile masks a deep sadness in her eyes.

**Background**: Myrna was a server in the fortress during its final feast. When disaster struck, she was caught in the dining hall and perished. Now she continues her duties, serving ghostly patrons in an endless recreation of her final day.

**Dialogue**:
- **Question**: "What's on the menu today?"
  **Answer**: "Today we're serving His Majesty's favorite—roast pheasant with herb stuffing, glazed root vegetables from the royal gardens, and fresh bread from the kitchen. For dessert, berry tarts with cream. Would you care for some wine? I recommend the vintage preserved in the cellar—quite safe to drink despite its age, and I've been told it restores vigor!"

- **Question**: "Who do you serve here?"
  **Answer**: "Why, the royal court, of course! Can't you see them? No, I suppose you wouldn't... Sometimes I forget that they're not really here anymore. I continue my duties all the same. The king would be most displeased if his table wasn't properly set, especially with important guests like yourself arriving."

- **Question**: "What happened during the last feast?"
  **Answer**: "Oh, it was terrible! We were serving the main course when the ground shook violently. The captain of the guard burst in, shouting about a dragon awakening below. There was such panic! The king ordered an evacuation, but in the chaos, many of us servants were forgotten. I remained at my post, thinking the nobles would return... they never did."

- **Question**: "Do you know any secrets about this place?"
  **Answer**: "Servants know everything about a household, don't we? The kitchen has a hidden stash of the cook's finest liquor behind the largest barrel. In the dining hall itself, the fireplace has a loose brick on the left side that hides the lord's emergency coin purse. And don't tell anyone, but I've seen the court jester sneak into a hidden passage from the Grand Chamber."

- **Question**: "Have you seen anything valuable in the dining hall?"
  **Answer**: "The silver goblets and decorative plates are quite valuable—the finest in the kingdom, imported from across the sea. But the most precious item would be the king's personal goblet at the head of the table. It's encrusted with small gemstones around the base. I've kept it polished all these years, though I cannot move it myself."

- **Question**: "Can I help you find peace?"
  **Answer**: "You're very kind to ask. I've often wondered why I remain when others have moved on. Perhaps it's because my final service was interrupted? If you could place a full setting at the king's place—a silver goblet, decorative plate, and utensils—I might feel my duty is complete. The items can be found scattered around the dining hall."

- **Question**: "Is the food safe to eat?"
  **Answer**: "The preserved fruit is quite safe—it was treated with magical preservatives from the wizard's stores. The wine bottle is also excellent and will restore your strength a bit. I wouldn't recommend anything from the kitchen unless you find it in sealed containers. The cook was experimenting with long-lasting rations before everything happened."

## Jibbo (Court Jester Ghost)
**Location**: Grand Chamber

**Description**: A colorfully dressed figure with a pointed hat adorned with bells. He flips and tumbles through the air, defying gravity in death as he likely did in life with acrobatics. His face is painted with an eternal smile, but his eyes reveal a sharp intelligence behind the foolish facade.

**Background**: Jibbo was the court jester, entertaining the king and nobles with jokes, acrobatics, and slight-of-hand magic. He was more than he appeared—also serving as the king's spy, using his access to gather information. He died defending the king during the catastrophe.

**Dialogue**:
- **Question**: "Tell me a joke."
  **Answer**: "Haha! What do you call a dragon who doesn't eat adventurers? Lackadaisical! Get it? Lacks-a-dine! Ah, tough crowd. Perhaps you'd prefer a riddle? What has keys but no locks, space but no room, and you can enter but not exit? A keyboard! No? Well, the afterlife has done little for my material, I'm afraid!"

- **Question**: "What do you know about the throne room?"
  **Answer**: "This grand chamber has seen better days, hasn't it? The king held court here daily, dispensing justice and hosting dignitaries. See the throne upon the dais? It has a secret compartment under the seat—just press the third jewel from the left. The king kept emergency escape plans there. Oh, and beware the stone guardian! It activates when anyone approaches the throne with weapons drawn."

- **Question**: "Were you really just a jester?"
  **Answer**: "Just a jester? My dear adventurer, the fool sees all! While nobles guarded their tongues around guards and advisors, they spoke freely before the king's silly entertainment. I had ears in every corner of this fortress and reported directly to His Majesty. The jingling of my bells covered many whispered conversations with the king. A pity my warnings about the wizards' dragon experiments came too late."

- **Question**: "How do I get to the Dragon's Lair?"
  **Answer**: "Seeking
